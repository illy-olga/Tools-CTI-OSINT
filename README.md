## 📖 **Description**  
In an era where cyber threats and data breaches are increasingly prevalent, having a robust and adaptable toolbox is essential for analysts, investigators, and cybersecurity researchers. This repository offers a diverse range of tools, from identifying exposed data to network mapping, domain analysis, IP investigation, phishing detection, and malware analysis.  

Each tool is accompanied by its category, access link, and supported data types to make it easier to use.

## 🛠️ **Upcoming Features**  
To enrich this project, **mind maps** will soon be added to guide users through various investigative scenarios. These interactive diagrams will detail the methodology for:  

- **🔎 Targeting an Individual**: Utilizing social networks, emails, and images to gather pertinent information.  
- **🏢 Targeting a Company**: Identifying the attack surface, associated domains, and public sensitive information.  
- **🌐 Targeting a Website**: Exploring vulnerabilities, technologies used, and potential data leaks.  

This project will evolve into a complete and intuitive resource for professionals and cybersecurity enthusiasts.
